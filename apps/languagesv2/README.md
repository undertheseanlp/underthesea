# Underthesea Languages v2

Like [duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/), but **opensource**

In recent years, I’ve been eager to develop an app for language learners. My initial attempt with the Underthesea Languages Project v1 didn’t go as planned; I aspired to build a super cool iOS app but didn’t achieve the desired success.

**What’s Missing**

With the rise of technologies like ChatGPT, learning subjects such as languages and math should be more accessible to everyone. However, I believe there are still crucial elements missing: a comprehensive learning map, motivational checkpoints, rewards, engaging multimedia content, and standardized certificates—all features that Duolingo implements exceptionally well.

**My Vision**

I aim to create a simple, open-source application for language learners. This app will enable users to track their progress, discover new content, and enjoy the learning process.
