# 🍯 Languages 

🍯 This app is inspired by Google Photos. I would like to create an app for managing words, articles.

🗣️ I always want to create an continual learning app (GH-529, GH-516, GH-485), where I can manage articles and explore sentences and words. So I'm going to create a web application for it. I call it 🍯 Languages

🤩 This work is mainly inspired by 🍬 Sketch Engine (it's an excellent corpus manager and text analysis software), 🍭 Google Photos (the app shows me how to combine effective UI/UX design and AI algorithms) and 🍰 LingQ (very intersting language learning app)

🤠 I will use react and django to create this app.

Let's what we can go 🏃
