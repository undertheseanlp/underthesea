Vietnamese text classification is an integral domain in Natural Language Processing (NLP) concerning the Vietnamese language. The objective of text classification is to assign predefined labels or categories to a given text based on its content. This report presents an overview of the challenges, methodologies, and advancements in Vietnamese text classification.

## Methodologies and Approaches

Zero-shot classification is a technique allowing models to categorize data into previously unseen classes without direct training. Leveraging large language models like GPT-3 and GPT-4, this method is invaluable when there's a shortage of labeled data or when it's impractical to gather annotations for every conceivable class. Such models use their vast training knowledge to generalize across tasks, making them versatile and adaptable to new classification challenges.

## Results

The following table presents the outcomes of the Vietnamese Text Classification endeavor when utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs):
