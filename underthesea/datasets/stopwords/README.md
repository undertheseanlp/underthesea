# Vietnamese Stopwords

As a product of the August 2021 Continual Learning Challenge, we attempt to develop a continually "new" set of stopwords for Vietnamese in `stopwords.txt`.

Methods being used (and possibly a combination):

* Inverse Document Frequency ([Source](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiE5aOBw7_yAhWEA3IKHWEvB4IQFnoECAMQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnlp.stanford.edu%2FIR-book%2Fhtml%2Fhtmledition%2Finverse-document-frequency-1.html&usg=AOvVaw0ozyLky-hEcQdhGnWFrsNM))
* Kullback-Leibler Divergence ([Source](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Automatically-Building-a-Stopword-List-for-an-Lo-He/af98454c504a4ce3567bc518d152b53ea7b2ee2a))
