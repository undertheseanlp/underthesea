# Open Vietnamese Dictionary

[Word In Progress]

In this project, we try to create an open dictionary for Vietnamese.

This is our attempt to build Vietnamese dictionary from scratch.
We known that building Vietnamese dictionary is a difficult and challenge job that requires great effort.

In the first phase, our goal was simply to bring the homogeneity of words and parts of speech into the corpus.

Let's see what we can achieve. 

## Part-of-speech categories

Open class words

* Tính từ (ADJ)
* Cảm từ (INTJ)
* Danh từ (NOUN)
* Đại từ (PROPN)
* Động từ (VERB)

Closed class words

* Kết từ (CCONJ & SCONJ)
* Phụ từ 
* Trợ từ
