# Vietnamese NLP Dataset for Continual Learning

A challenge for Vietnamese NLP Continual Learning.

In the past, Underthesea has mainly focused on tuning model. With this project, we create a simple challenge for ourselves to build a continuous learning NLP system.

The August 2021 Challenges include [part-of-speech tagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging) and [dependency parsing](https://universaldependencies.org/).

Three levels of sentence:

* Bronze: Automatic tagging by underthesea
* Silver: Corrected by at least a human
* Gold: Verified by at least 03 humans
