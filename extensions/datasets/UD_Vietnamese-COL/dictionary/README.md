# Open Vietnamese Dictionary

[Word In Progress]

In this project, we try to create an open dictionary for Vietnamese.

This is our attempt to build Vietnamese dictionary from scratch.
We known that building Vietnamese dictionary is a difficult and challenge job that requires great effort.
But the idea of being able to build an open dictionary for Vietnamese was so compelling that we thought we were crazy enough to do it.
Who knows, we might be lucky enough to succeed.

In the first phase, our goal was simply to bring the homogeneity of words and parts of speech into the corpus.

After having built dictionary software with basic functions, we focused on using the defined words from two open Vietnamese dictionary projects, Hồ Ngọc Đức dictionary and Vietnamese Wiktionary.

Let's see what we can achieve. 

## Part-of-speech categories

5 Open class words

* Danh từ (noun)
* Động từ (verb)
* Tính từ (adjective)
* Trạng từ (adverb)
* Cảm từ (interjection)

6 Closed class words

* Đại từ (pronoun)
* Số từ (numeral)
* Liên từ (conjunction)
* Giới từ (preposition)
* Trợ từ (auxiliary)
* Định từ (determiner)
